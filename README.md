# BilliotComputationalLab_WarmupProblems

In this repository, sets of warmup training problems (i.e., functions with set objectives that must be coded in) are created and stored. In addition, student solutions will be collected in this repository.

Please take care to make a new Python file with all solutions and name it according to the following format: assuming that my name is Nathan Black and I am working on Set 1, I would name my solution file

nblack_warmupset1.py
